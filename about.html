  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Greenium, incorporated in 2020, is an organization that has visionary ideas of greener and better living.
    Bearing this in mind, we have set up our operations in New Delhi across India to supply a gamut of plants to all our clients.
    Greenium is a leading plant supplier in India where you can buy plants online, including fruit plants, exotic and imported plants, and horticultural and flowering plants.
    We aim to offer our clients superior quality plants across India and operate under Government projects of landscaping, vertical gardens and so on.

  <h2>CEO's Story</h2>
  <p>
    My story begins back when I had returned from Manchester, England, after completing Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.
    Upon returning, I noticed that plants and greenery were largely ignored across the roads of Delhi.
    This is where I started my personal search for advanced possibilities to make a successful, constructive and hopeful contribution to the overall climate change in India by bringing individuals closer to nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    While having a degree in Chemical Engineering, I sought to utilize my skills and knowledge to make a better living for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this vision, we started Greenium in 2020, to raise awareness about the importance of having plants and making way for a life better health, education and political awareness by having individuals buy green quality plants through the use of technology and making it available and affordable for all.

  <h2>MD's Story</h2>
  <p>
    In 2020, my brother and I found ourselves in a conversation about the importance of boosting our immunity, especially in the wake of the pandemic.
    This sparked an idea, leading us to the concept of gifting oxygen-providing plants.
    What began as a simple, heartfelt initiative to promote wellness has since blossomed into a thriving business that caters to a broad spectrum of plants and agricultural inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the core of our venture lies an unwavering commitment to sustainability.
    It’s not just a buzzword for us—it’s the driving force behind everything we do.
    Every day, we wake up with the goal of contributing to a greener, healthier India.
    Our vision is to create a one-stop destination for all agricultural needs, making sustainable living accessible to everyone.
  </p>
  <p><em>And that’s the story of how a small idea turned into a passion-driven journey toward making a tangible impact on the world around us!</em><br>
  <strong>Himanshi Chandak (Co-Founder & Managing Director), Greenium</strong></p>
